# Challenge-1-Python-with-table-charts-and-html

This is my first challenge to check my knowledge in python.

How it works

It loads a json data;

Creates a HTML table to analyze the raw data and some calculation;

Creates some charts with that data.

I made it in two ways to test myself

data_analysis_pandas.py > uses pandas to deal with the data (I feel more confident on that one and its much more easy for me)

data_analysis_normal.py > uses "for" to deal with the data (Took much more time for me and I didn't finish properly.
